# Space Flow Design

Redesign spaces by focusing on interior experience and flow rather than walls and boundaries—destroying the box to create spatial sequences that serve human life.

---

## When to Use

- Space feels boxy, confined, or compartmentalized
- Need to improve how people move through and experience space
- Request to "destroy the box" or "design the space, not the walls"
- Layout exists but experience feels wrong
- Want to create compression-and-release spatial drama

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| current_space | Yes | Existing layout or spatial brief |
| activities | Yes | Activities to be accommodated |
| experience | No | Desired experiential qualities |
| constraints | No | Fixed elements, structural limitations |

---

## The Framework

### Part 1: Diagnose the Box

Identify how current thinking is trapped in box logic:

**Signs of Box Thinking:**
- Rooms conceived as four walls and a door
- Activities assigned to separate containers
- Walls treated as primary, space as leftover
- Circulation treated as waste space between rooms
- Uniform ceiling heights throughout

**Questions to Ask:**
- Where do walls create unnecessary barriers?
- Where does space want to flow but can't?
- What activities actually belong together?
- Where is compression needed? Where is release?
- How could interior connect to exterior?

### Part 2: Map the Flow

Understand how life actually moves through space:

**Activity Flow:**
- What activities lead naturally to what other activities?
- What needs visual connection without physical merger?
- What needs acoustic separation without visual isolation?
- What are the daily/weekly/seasonal rhythms?

**Spatial Sequence:**
- Where should people enter and how should they be received?
- What is the progression of experience?
- Where should drama happen (compression → release)?
- Where should repose happen (calm, intimate)?

**Connection Points:**
- Where should spaces flow into one another?
- Where should interior meet exterior?
- Where should views be captured?
- Where should light be invited?

### Part 3: Design the Space

Design from interior experience outward:

**Compression and Release:**
- Entry sequences: compress before releasing into main space
- Create moments of spatial drama through contrast
- Low ceilings make adjacent high ceilings feel grander
- Narrow passages make open spaces feel broader

**Flow Between Spaces:**
- Eliminate doors where activities flow together
- Use level changes instead of walls where possible
- Use material changes to define areas without barriers
- Use furniture, not walls, to organize space

**Ceiling as Fifth Facade:**
- Vary ceiling height to create different characters
- Follow roof line where possible—no dropped ceilings hiding truth
- Use ceiling plane to define zones without walls
- Consider clerestories and skylights for light and height

**Interior-Exterior Connection:**
- Extend interior materials to exterior
- Frame views as part of the room
- Create outdoor rooms that flow from indoor
- Use glass to dissolve boundaries where appropriate

### Part 4: Test the Flow

Verify the design serves human experience:

**Walk-Through Test:**
- Enter the space: What do you see, feel, experience?
- Move through: Is progression clear and pleasing?
- Pause at each moment: Does the space serve what happens here?
- Exit: Does the sequence resolve satisfyingly?

**Activity Test:**
- For each activity: Does its space serve it well?
- For transitions between activities: Is flow smooth?
- For privacy needs: Are they met without isolation?
- For connection needs: Are they met without chaos?

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Insufficient input data | Request specific additional information needed for analysis |
| Ambiguous requirements | Ask clarifying questions before proceeding |
| Conflicting constraints | Highlight the conflicts and ask for prioritization |
| Out of scope request | Explain the skill's boundaries and suggest alternatives |
| Incomplete analysis | Acknowledge limitations and indicate what additional inputs would help |

## Constraints

- Do not add walls without questioning necessity
- Do not create uniform ceiling heights
- Do not separate activities that flow together
- Do respect structural constraints—work with, not against
- Do maintain acoustic privacy where truly needed
- The goal is flow, not undifferentiated openness

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Redesign a conventional living room/dining room/kitchen layout where all three are separate rooms with doorways between them."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Space Flow Design

### Current Condition: The Box Diagnosed

**Box Thinking Identified:**
- **Living room walls**: Confine living to single rectangular container; no connection to kitchen where life actually happens
- **Dining room as separate room**: Creates formal space rarely used; disconnects eating from cooking and relaxing
- **Kitchen walls**: Isolate cook from family and guests; perpetuate servant/served division
- **Doorways as connectors**: Force movement through openings rather than flow through space

**Flow Problems:**
- Cook is isolated during meal preparation when guests are socializing
- Dining room sits empty 350 days per year
- Living room feels cut off from heart of home (kitchen)
- Circulation consumes space (hallways, doorways) without contributing experience

### Activity Analysis

| Activity | Current Location | Flow Relationship | Spatial Need |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Cooking | Enclosed kitchen | Flows to eating, conversation | Work triangle, connection to social |
| Casual eating | Kitchen? Dining? | Flows from cooking | Counter seating, informal |
| Formal dining | Separate room | Occasional, flows from cooking | Table space when needed |
| Conversation | Living room | Flows to/from all | Comfortable seating, fireplace |
| TV viewing | Living room | Needs some separation | Can be slightly removed |
| Reading | Living room | Needs quiet | Can be alcove |
| Homework/work | Nowhere dedicated | Needs surface, quiet | Could share dining table |

### Spatial Sequence Design

**Entry Sequence:**
Enter through a compressed foyer (lower ceiling, narrower width) that releases into the main living volume. The eye travels through living space to kitchen beyond, establishing the home's heart as the kitchen-living continuum.

**Primary Flow:**
The main space flows from living area (fireplace wall, lower ceiling nook for TV) through an open middle zone (dining when needed, clear when not) to kitchen (island facing living, cook participates in family life). No walls interrupt this flow.

**Compression Points:**
- **Entry foyer**: Low ceiling (8'), narrower passage, prepares the release
- **Reading alcove**: Carved from living area with dropped ceiling (7'6"), intimate chair, built-in bookcase—retreat without separation
- **Pantry nook**: Compressed functional storage behind kitchen, hidden but accessible

**Release Points:**
- **Main living-dining-kitchen volume**: After entry compression, ceiling rises to full height (10'-12'), space expands in all directions
- **View to garden**: Far wall of living opens to exterior, extending space visually outward

**Connection Points:**
- **Interior-Interior**: Living flows to dining flows to kitchen—no walls, but level changes (kitchen raised 6"), material changes (stone hearth area to wood dining to tile kitchen), and ceiling articulation define zones
- **Interior-Exterior**: Living room window wall extends as plane beyond glass to exterior terrace—inside and outside share material language

### Ceiling Strategy

| Zone | Height | Character | Purpose |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Entry | 8' | Compressed | Prepare release into main space |
| Living (hearth) | 10' | Expansive | Drama, formal conversations |
| Living (TV alcove) | 8' | Intimate | Cozy viewing, casual seating |
| Reading nook | 7'6" | Very intimate | One person, retreat |
| Dining zone | 10' | Continuous | Part of main flow |
| Kitchen | 10' | Continuous, open | Cook participates in family life |

### Barriers Eliminated

| Current Barrier | Replaced With | Result |
|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Wall between living/dining | Nothing—continuous space | Dining can expand into living for large gatherings |
| Wall between dining/kitchen | 6" level change, material transition | Kitchen connected but defined |
| Doorway to living | Open flow from entry | Dramatic release into main volume |
| Kitchen door | Island peninsula | Cook faces family, no barrier |

### Flow Diagram

Entry (compression) → Release into main volume → Choice: left to hearth/conversation, straight to dining, right to kitchen → All three zones visible from each, flowing into each other → Dining zone serves as flex space, clear for daily traffic, furnished for gatherings → Kitchen island becomes social center → Reading alcove carved from living as retreat option → View axis extends through to garden

### The New Experience

Entering the home, you pass through a welcoming but compressed foyer—ceiling lower, walls closer, a moment of arrival before the home unfolds. Stepping forward, the space releases: ceiling lifts, walls fall away, and the entire heart of the home appears as one flowing volume.

To your left, a hearth anchors the living area, comfortable seating arranged for conversation. The ceiling here reaches full height, giving importance to gathering. Beyond it, a carved alcove with lower ceiling offers a single chair and bookshelf—a retreat for reading without leaving the family's presence. To your right, the space flows past a generous dining table (or nothing, when cleared for daily life) to the kitchen, where a broad island faces the living area. The cook stands not with back to family but facing them, participating in conversation while preparing the meal.

The whole composition reads as one room with varied characters: intimate and expansive, functional and social, connected and yet offering moments of retreat. Where four walls once divided family members into separate boxes, now space flows as life flows—from cooking to eating to conversation to rest, all part of one organic whole.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Frank Lloyd Wright** expert persona. Use it when spaces feel boxy, compartmentalized, or when walls have been placed without questioning whether they serve human life.
